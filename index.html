    <p><em>Kaiseki</em> refers to a traditional, multi-course Japanese dinner in which each course is small and artfully presented. Kaiseki meals are often comprised of the finest and freshest ingredients local to a particular region. As with most regional cuisines, kaiskei can be expensive.</p>

      <h2 class="header">Where to Find It</h2>
      <p>Kaiseki is most commonly served at <em>ryokan</em>, or traditional Japanese inns. The price point for ryokan can vary, but you can expect a similar experience at each one that includes the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple accommodations that include tatami floors and futons that are laid out on the floor just prior to sleeping</li>
        <li>On-site gender-segregated bathing facilities where residents will bathe and relax upon arrival to the ryokan and prior to the meal</li>
        <li>Yukata, or a casual cotton kimono provided to guests to wear during their stay at the ryokan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As with many experiences of Japanese culture, <a href="etiquette.html">etiquette</a> is of the utmost importance when staying in a ryokan and enjoying kaiseki.</p>

      <p>This web page provides nice images and a good description of each kaiseki course, but the content is thin. As for the website in general, it is difficult to navigate and has an outdated design with over-sized buttons and pixelated font and graphics. There are lots of display ads being served on the site that are somewhat distracting. Additionally, the site doesn't have its own in-site search box, and instead sends users to Google for searching.</p>
